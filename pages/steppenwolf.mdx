# Steppenwolf

"In Steppenwolf's case, the fact is that, like all hybrid creatures, he lived with the feeling of being sometimes a wolf, sometimes a human being.
However, as a wolf he was forever conscious of his human side lying in wait, observing, judging and condemning him; just as the wolf did when he was a human being.
For example, whenever Harry in his capacity as a human being had some lovely idea, experience some fine and noble sentiment, or did a so-called good deed, the wolf in him would bare its teeth and laugh him utterly to scorn, indicating how ludicrously out of character all this fine play-acting was in a wild animal of the steppes, a wolf who at heart knew perfectly well that his real pleasure lay in stalking alone across the plains, occasionally blood or pursuing a she-wolf.
Seen thus from the wolf's point of view, every human action became frighteningly comic and self-conscious, vain and inane.
But it was exactly the same when Harry felt and behaved like a wolf, when he showed other people his teeth or became murderously hostile to humankind as a whole, hating all its hypocritical and degenerate manners and customs.
For then it was the human side of him that lay in wait, observing the wolf, calling him a brute and a beast, spoiling and souring all the pleasure he was taking in the straightforward life of a healthy untamed wolf.
...
His position was a lonely one; it was uncanny the way the world left him to his own devices.
Other people were longer of concern to him; he wasn't even concerned about himself.
The air around him was getting thinner and thinner the more solitary he became, severing all contact with others, and he was slowly suffocating as a result.
For the situation now was different.
No longer his desire and goal, solitude and independence were a fate he was condemned to.
He had made his magic wish and there was no going back on it.
However strongly he yearned to re-establish contact with others, however willing he was to hold out his arms to embrace them, it was of no avail: they now left him alone.
Yet there was no indication that people hated him or found him repugnant.
On the contrary; he had lots of friends.
Lots of people liked him.
But friendliness and sympathy were the only reactions he ever encountered.
People would invite him to their homes, give him presents, write him nice letters, but nobody was able or willing to share his life.
He was no breathing the air that the lonely breathe, living in an atmosphere that was still, adrift from the world around him.
No amount of yearning or goodwill had any effect on his inability to form relationships."
